<p class="Introduction">
    Using optimization techniques to deal with data separation and data analysis goes back to more than thirty years ago. According to O. L. Mangasarian, his group has formulated linear programming as a large margin classifier in 1960’s. Nowadays classical optimization techniques have found widespread use in solving various data mining problems, among which convex optimization and mathematical programming have occupied the center-stage. With the advantage of convex optimization’s elegant property of global optimum, many problems can be cast into the convex optimization framework, such as Support Vector Machines, graph-based manifold learning, and clustering, which can usually be solved by convex Quadratic Programming, Semi-Definite Programming or Eigenvalue Decomposition. Another research emphasis is applying mathematical programming into the classification. For the last twenty years, the researchers have extensively applied quadratic programming into classification, known as V. Vapnik’s Support Vector Machine, as well as various applications. <br> <br>
As time goes by, new problems emerge constantly in data mining community, such as Time-Evolving Data Mining, On-Line Data Mining, Relational Data Mining and Transferred Data Mining.  Some of these recently emerged problems are more complex than traditional ones and are usually formulated as nonconvex problems. Therefore some general optimization methods, such as gradient descents, coordinate descents, convex relaxation, have come back to the stage and become more and more popular in recent years. From another side of mathematical programming, In 1970’s, A. Charnes and W.W. Cooper initiated Data Envelopment Analysis where a fractional programming is used to evaluate decision making units, which is economic representative data in a given training dataset. From 1980’s to 1990’s, F. Glover proposed a number of linear programming models to solve discriminant problems with a small sample size of data.  Then, since 1998, multiple criteria linear programming (MCLP) and multiple criteria quadratic programming (MCQP) has also extended in classification. All of these methods differ from statistics, decision tree induction, and neural networks. So far, there are more than 200 scholars around the world have been actively working on the field of using optimization techniques to handle data mining problems.<br><br>
This workshop will present recent advances in optimization techniques for, especially new emerging, data mining problems, as well as the real-life applications among. One main goal of the workshop is to bring together the leading researchers who work on state-of-the-art algorithms on optimization based methods for modern data analysis, and also the practitioners who seek for novel applications. In summary, this workshop will strive to emphasize the following aspects:
<ul class="list01">

<li>Presenting recent advances in algorithms and methods using optimization techniques</li>
<li>Addressing the fundamental challenges in data mining using optimization techniques</li>
<li>Identifying killer applications and key industry drivers (where theories and applications meet)</li>
<li>ostering interactions among researchers (from different backgrounds) sharing the same interest to promote cross-fertilization of ideas.</li>
<li>Exploring benchmark data for better evaluation of the techniques</li>
</ul>

    </p>
	<p class="Introduction"> 
	<ul>
	<li><b>Submission Guidelines</b></li>
	<p>Paper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, in the IEEE 2-column format (<a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">link</a>), including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review. All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to scope of the conference, originality, significance, and clarity. The following sections give further information for authors. Please refer to the ICDM regular submission requirment for more information: <a href="http://39.104.72.142:8080/icdm2019/index.php/call-for-papers/">http://icdm2019.bigke.org/</a>  </p>
    <li><b>How to prepare your submissions</b></li>
	<p>The authors shall omit their names from the submission. For formatting templates with author and institution information, simply replace all these information in the template by “Anonymous”.</p>
	<p>In the submission, the authors’ should refer to their own prior work like the prior work of any other author, and include all relevant citations. This can be done either by referring to their prior work in the third person or referencing papers generically. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on clustering, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on distance-based clustering (Smith 2005),”  you might say “We extend Smith’s (Smith 2005) earlier work on distance-based clustering.”</p>
	  <p>The authors shall exclude citations to their own work which is not fundamental to understanding the paper, including prior versions (e.g., technical reports, unpublished internal documents) of the submitted paper. They should reference only necessary work using point (2). Hence, do not write: “In our previous work [3]” as it reveals that citation 3 is written by the current authors.</p>
	  <p>The authors shall remove mention of funding sources, personal acknowledgments, and other such auxiliary information that could be related to their identities. These can be reinstituted in the camera-ready copy once the paper is accepted for publication.</p>
	  <p>The authors shall make statements on well-known or unique systems that identify an author, as vague in respect to identifying the authors as possible.</p>
	  <p>The submitted files shall be named with care to ensure that authors’ anonymity is not compromised by the file name. For example, do not name your submission “Smith.pdf”, instead give it a name that is descriptive of the title of your paper, such as “ANewApproachtoClustering.pdf” (or a shorter version of the same).</p>
	  <p>Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings by the IEEE Computer SocietyPress.</p>
	
	<li><b>Online Submission System</b></li>
	<p>All manuscripts are submitted as full papers and are reviewed based on their scientific merit. The reviewing process is confidential. There is no separate abstract submission step. There are no separate industrial, application, short paper or poster tracks. Manuscripts must be submitted electronically in <a href="http://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2019/icdm19/index.php">online submission system</a>. <b>We do not accept email submissions.</b></p>

	<p><b>Note that all accepted papers will be included in the IEEE ICDM 2019 Workshops Proceedings volume published by IEEE Computer Society Press, and will also be included in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. ​​Therefore, papers must not have been accepted for publication elsewhere or be under review for another workshop, conferences or journals.</b></p>

    <p class="Introduction">
        Our workshop is scheduled to hold on the morning of Nov 8 2019. Due to room limitations of the conference, OEDM'19 and DMIIOT'19 (Workshop on Data Mining in Industrial Internet of Things) have merged to together and named "<b>OEDM & DMIIOT</b>". DMIIOT is an industry oriented workshop focusing on the combination of data mining techniques and internet of things, and the detailed information can be found in its <a href="http://aistrike.us/cfp.html">website</a>. The accepted papers of both workshops will be presented alternately and we believe this will bring new thoughts to attendees from both workshops.
